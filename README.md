## 📦 Installation

2️⃣ **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend**

```bash

3️⃣ **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3020/api
```

4️⃣ **Run the app**

## 🔑 **How to use**

1️⃣ Copy this into a file called `README.md` in your root folder

If you want, I can also help you write:
- a good `.gitignore`
- a `package.json` cleanup
- or a deployment guide.

Just say **“Next!”** 🚀✨
